This project builds a machine learning system to predict Airbnb listing prices. Accurate pricing helps hosts maximize occupancy and revenue while ensuring travelers see fair, competitive rates. Using historical Airbnb data, we explore price drivers and train regression models to estimate prices for new or hypothetical listings.

Objectives
Predict listing price from features such as location, room type, host attributes, demand proxies, and ratings.
Analyze relationships between price, demand (reviews per month), ratings, availability, and booking options.
Provide data-driven recommendations for pricing and listing configuration.
Who benefits
Airbnb Hosts: Optimize pricing based on features and guest feedback.
Travelers: Assess whether a listing is fairly priced relative to similar options.
Platform Analysts: Enhance automated pricing guidance and transparency.
Researchers/Students: Study how features and reviews influence rental pricing.
Repository contents

Setup
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
# Windows PowerShell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Launch Jupyter and open the notebook.
jupyter notebook
Open Adil_nazir_dar_Source_Code.ipynb and run cells top-to-bottom.
Ensure DataSetProject.csv is present in the project root (update paths in the notebook if needed).
Key analyses and models (in the notebook)
Data cleaning and feature typing for pricing and demand proxies.
Exploratory analysis of room types, neighborhoods, pricing, host verification, and fees.
Correlation and regression analyses: price vs. demand (reviews per month) and ratings.
Predictive models:
Linear regression to estimate demand from price, location, room type, and booking options.
KMeans clustering to segment listings by price, demand, ratings, and availability.
Data-driven recommendations (from analysis)
Price competitively by neighbourhood group and room type; monitor impact on reviews per month.
Enable instant_bookable where feasible to lift demand.
Prefer more flexible cancellation_policy to support higher ratings.
Use seasonality proxies (by last review month) for dynamic pricing and minimum-stay tuning.
Standardize quality and responsiveness for multi-listing hosts; keep identity verified.
Apply cluster profiles to tailor pricing and amenity investments per segment.
Reproducibility notes
Dependencies are pinned in requirements.txt.
Random seeds are set where applicable, but results may vary slightly by platform and data filtering.
